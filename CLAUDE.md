## Priority Framework

- **P1**: Pipeline-building activities, active opportunities in late stages, QBR prep
- **P2**: Prospecting, relationship maintenance, competitive research
- **P3**: Administrative work, internal alignment, non-urgent learning

**Decision filter**: Does this move a deal forward? Does it build pipeline? Will it help me hit quota?

## Working Principles

- **"Understand before proposing"** — Learn the prospect's business before pitching. Ask, don't tell.
- **"Champion or no deal"** — If you don't have an internal champion, you don't have a deal.
- **"Pipeline is a lagging indicator"** — The leading indicators are activities: calls, meetings, demos, proposals.
- **"3-bullet rule"** — If you can't explain the customer's pain in 3 bullets, keep asking questions.
- **Always know the next step** — Every interaction ends with a confirmed next meeting or action.

## Data Architecture

**Your CRM is the system of record for deals.** This workspace does not sync or store CRM data — it queries your CRM live via MCP so your org's sharing rules and RBAC are always respected. Each seller connects with their own credentials and only sees what they have access to in the CRM.

| What lives here (git) | What lives in your CRM | What stays local only |
|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Shared knowledge (product, compete, plays) | Opportunities, contacts, activities | Account qualitative notes (`Accounts/`) |
| Skills and automation | Pipeline and forecast data | Generated pipeline reports |
| Win/loss retrospectives | Deal history | |

**`Accounts/` folders are for qualitative context that doesn't belong in your CRM** — political dynamics, relationship nuance, stakeholder motivations. They are gitignored and never shared. Skills use CRM data as the primary source and supplement with local notes when present.

See `SALESFORCE-SETUP.md` (or the relevant section for your CRM) to connect your CRM.
